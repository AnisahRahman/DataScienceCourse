What is Data Visualization
======================================

- Data visualisation is the visual communication of information and data generated by different research processes in an understandable, clear and effective manner.

- Information visualization is the method of presenting information as a visual representation to help in the understanding of unrelated data elements. This helps to correlate casual relationships of data into examples of meaningful information.

- In the area of problem solving, visual representations of data have proven to be the most effective way of communicating information. Information visualization is used daily throughout society in the forms of weather maps, geospatial technology, graphs, and maps. The primary benefit of using pictures to represent data is the unique ability to disseminate relevant information quickly as compared to interpretation provided by reading basic words and numbers.
