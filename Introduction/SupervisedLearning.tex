\section{Supervised learning}


Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from supervised training data. The training data consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which is called a classifier (if the output is discrete, see classification) or a regression function (if the output is continuous, see regression). The inferred function should predict the correct output value for any valid input object. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations 

in a "reasonable" way (see inductive bias).
