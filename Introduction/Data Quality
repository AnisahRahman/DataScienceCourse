Data Quality
=========================
### Dirty Data
In a data warehouse, dirty data is a database record that contains errors. Dirty data can be caused by a number of factors including duplicate records, incomplete or outdated data, and the improper parsing of record fields from disparate systems. The \emph{Data Warehousing Institute (TDWI)} estimates that dirty data costs U.S. businesses more than 600 billion dollars each year.

### Data Corruption
Data corruption is the deterioration of computer data as a result of some external agent. Hazards to data integrity include not only computer-based problems such as viruses and hardware or software incompatibility, flaws, or failures, but also environmental threats such as power outages, dust, water, and extreme temperatures. 

To protect data from corruption, you should ensure that only authorized people have access to your data and that the physical environment is safe from environmental hazards.
