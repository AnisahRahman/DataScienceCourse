Introduction to Data Mining
====================================

### Broad and Narrow Definitions
 
- Broad definition includes traditional statistical techniques
- Narrow definition emphasizes automated and heuristic methods
- Key concepts in Data Mining Include : data dredging , fishing expeditions
- Key paper: Knowledge Discovery in Databases (Usama Fayyad)

### What is Data Mining
- First Workshop on Data Mining KDD was in 1995
- Recently coined terms for confluence of ideas from statistics and computers science (Machine Learning and Database Methods) applied to 
large databases in science, engineering and business
- In a state of flux, many definitions, lots of debate about what it is and what it is not.
- Terminology is not standard (e.g. bias classification, prediction, features (independent variables)
target (dependent variables), case (explempar, row)

- Solution: Use of a Technique known as ***collaborative filtering***
- Benefit : Increased Revenue by Cross Selling, Up Selling


### Emerging Major Data Mining Applications
- SPam filtering
- Bioinformatics/Genomics
- Medical History Data - Insurance Claims
- Personalization of servies in e-commerce
- RF tags (gillette)
- Security 
 - Container Shipments
 - Network Intrusion Systems
