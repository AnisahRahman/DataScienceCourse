\subsection{Distance measures}
Distance can be measured in a variety of ways. There are distances that are Euclidean (can be measured with a ruler) and there are other distances based on similarity. For example, in terms of
geographical distance (i.e. Euclidean distance) Perth, Australia is closer to Jakarta, Indonesia, than it is to Sydney, Australia.

However, if distance is measured in terms of the cities characteristics, Perth is closer to Sydney (e.g. both on a big river estuary, straddling both sides of the river, with surfing beaches, and both English speaking, etc). A number of distance measures are available within SPSS. The \textbf{\textit{squared Euclidean distance}} is the most widely used measure.

\subsection{Squared Euclidean distance}

The most straightforward and generally accepted way of computing distances between objects in a multi-dimensional space is to compute Euclidean distances, an extension of Pythagoras's theorem.
If we had a two- or three-dimensional space this measure is the actual geometric distance between objects in the space (i.e. as if measured with a ruler).

In a univariate example, the Euclidean distance between two values is the arithmetic difference, i.e. \textbf{\textit{value1 - value2}}. In the bivariate case, the minimum distance is the hypotenuse of a triangle formed from the points, as in Pythagoras's theorem.

Although difficult to visualize, an extension of the Pythagoras's theorem will give the distance between two points in n-dimensional space. The squared Euclidean distance is used more often than the simple Euclidean distance in order to place progressively greater weight on objects that are further apart. Euclidean (and squared Euclidean) distances are usually computed from raw data, and not from transformed data, e.g. standardized data.

\section{Euclidean Distance}
The Euclidean distance between two points, x and y, with $k$ dimensions is calculated as:
\[ \sqrt{ \sum^{k}_{j=1} ( x_j - y_j)^2 } \]
The Euclidean distance is always greater than or equal to zero. The measurement would be zero for identical points and high for points that show little similarity.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Example}
Compute the Euclidean Distance between the following points:
$X = \{1,5,4,3\}$ and $Y = \{2,1,8,7\}$

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
$x_j$	&	$y_j$	&   $x_j - y_j$	&	$(x_j - y_j)^2$	\\ \hline
1	&	2	&	-1	&	1	\\
5	&	1	&	4	&	16	\\
4	&	8	&	-4	&	16	\\
3	&	7	&	-4	&	16	\\ \hline
	&		&		&	49	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The Euclidean Distance between the two points is $\sqrt{49}$ i.e. 7.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Squared Euclidean Distance}
The Squared Euclidean distance between two points, x and y, with $k$ dimensions is calculated as:
\[ \sum^{k}_{j=1} ( x_j - y_j)^2  \]
The Squared Euclidean distance may be preferred to the Euclidean distance as it is slightly less computational complex, without loss of any information.

\section{Manhattan (City Block) Distance}
The City block distance between two points, x and y, with $k$ dimensions is calculated as:
\[ \sum^{k}_{j=1} | x_j - y_j |  \]

The City block distance is always greater than or equal to zero. The measurement would be zero for identical points and high for points that show little similarity.

\subsection{Example}
Compute the Manhattan Distance between the following points: 
$X = \{1,3,4,2\}$ and $Y = \{5,2,5,2\}$


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
$x_j$	&	$y_j$	&   $x_j - y_j$	&	$| x_j - y_j |$	\\ \hline
1	&	5	&	-4	&	4	\\
3	&	2	&	1	&	1	\\
4	&	5	&	-1	&	1	\\
2	&	2	&	0	&	0	\\ \hline
& & & 6 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The Manhattan Distance between the two points is 6.

Distance Measures

The joining or tree clustering method uses the dissimilarities (similarities) or distances between objects when forming the clusters. Similarities are a set of rules that serve as criteria for grouping or separating items. In the previous example the rule for grouping a number of dinners was whether they shared the same table or not. These distances (similarities) can be based on a single dimension or multiple dimensions, with each dimension representing a rule or condition for grouping objects. For example, if we were to cluster fast foods, we could take into account the number of calories they contain, their price, subjective ratings of taste, etc. The most straightforward way of computing distances between objects in a multi-dimensional space is to compute Euclidean distances. If we had a two- or three-dimensional space this measure is the actual geometric distance between objects in the space (i.e., as if measured with a ruler). However, the joining algorithm does not "care" whether the distances that are "fed" to it are actual real distances, or some other derived measure of distance that is more meaningful to the researcher; and it is up to the researcher to select the right method for his/her specific application.
Euclidean distance. This is probably the most commonly chosen type of distance. It simply is the geometric distance in the multidimensional space. It is computed as:
distance(x,y) = {i (xi - yi)2 }Â½
Note that Euclidean (and squared Euclidean) distances are usually computed from raw data, and not from standardized data. This method has certain advantages (e.g., the distance between any two objects is not affected by the addition of new objects to the analysis, which may be outliers). However, the distances can be greatly affected by differences in scale among the dimensions from which the distances are computed. For example, if one of the dimensions denotes a measured length in centimeters, and you then convert it to millimeters (by multiplying the values by 10), the resulting Euclidean or squared Euclidean distances (computed from multiple dimensions) can be greatly affected (i.e., biased by those dimensions which have a larger scale), and consequently, the results of cluster analyses may be very different. Generally, it is good practice to transform the dimensions so they have similar scales.
Squared Euclidean distance. You may want to square the standard Euclidean distance in order to place progressively greater weight on objects that are further apart. This distance is computed as (see also the note in the previous paragraph):
distance(x,y) = i (xi - yi)2
City-block (Manhattan) distance. This distance is simply the average difference across dimensions. In most cases, this distance measure yields results similar to the simple Euclidean distance. However, note that in this measure, the effect of single large differences (outliers) is dampened (since they are not squared). The city-block distance is computed as:
distance(x,y) = i |xi - yi|
Chebychev distance. This distance measure may be appropriate in cases when we want to define two objects as "different" if they are different on any one of the dimensions. The Chebychev distance is computed as:
distance(x,y) = Maximum|xi - yi|
Power distance. Sometimes we may want to increase or decrease the progressive weight that is placed on dimensions on which the respective objects are very different. This can be accomplished via the power distance. The power distance is computed as:
distance(x,y) = (i |xi - yi|p)1/r
where r and p are user-defined parameters. A few example calculations may demonstrate how this measure "behaves." Parameter p controls the progressive weight that is placed on differences on individual dimensions, parameter r controls the progressive weight that is placed on larger differences between objects. If r and p are equal to 2, then this distance is equal to the Euclidean distance.
Percent disagreement. This measure is particularly useful if the data for the dimensions included in the analysis are categorical in nature. This distance is computed as:
distance(x,y) = (Number of xi  yi)/ i
