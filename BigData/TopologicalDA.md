Topological data analysis 
==========================
Topological data analysis (TDA) is a new area of study aimed at having applications in areas such as data mining and computer vision. The main problems are:

- how one infers high-dimensional structure from low-dimensional representations; and
- how one assembles discrete points into global structure.
- The human brain can easily extract global structure from representations in a strictly lower dimension, i.e. we infer a 3D environment from a 2D image from each eye. The inference of global structure also occurs when converting discrete data into continuous images, e.g. dot-matrix printers and televisions communicate images via arrays of discrete points.

The main method used by topological data analysis is:

- Replace a set of data points with a family of simplicial complexes, indexed by a proximity parameter.
- Analyse these topological complexes via algebraic topology â€” specifically, via the theory of persistent homology.
- Encode the persistent homology of a data set in the form of a parameterized version of a Betti number which is called a persistence diagram or barcode.[1]
