What is Big Data?
=========================
- Big data (also spelled Big Data) is a general term used to describe the voluminous amount of unstructured and semi-structured data a company creates, data that would take too much time and cost too much money to load into a relational database for analysis. Although Big data doesn't refer to any specific quantity, the term is often used when speaking about \textbf{\emph{petabytes}} and \textbf{\emph{exabytes}} of data.

- A primary goal for looking at big data is to discover repeatable business patterns. 

- Itis generally accepted that unstructured data, most of it located in text files, accounts for at least 80% of an 
 organizations data. If left unmanaged, the sheer volume of unstructured data thats generated each year within an enterprise can be costly in terms of storage. Unmanaged data can also pose a liability if information cannot be located in the event of a compliance audit or lawsuit.

- Big data analytics is often associated with cloud computing because the analysis of large data sets in real-time requires a framework like \textbf{\emph{MapReduce}} to distribute the work among tens, hundreds or even thousands of computers.

- **Volume**. Many factors contribute to the increase in data volume. Transaction-based data stored through the years. Unstructured data streaming in from social media. Increasing amounts of sensor and machine-to-machine data being collected. In the past, excessive data volume was a storage issue. But with decreasing storage costs, other issues emerge, including how to determine relevance within large data volumes and how to use analytics to create value from relevant data.

- **Velocity**. Data is streaming in at unprecedented speed and must be dealt with in a timely manner. RFID tags, sensors and smart metering are driving the need to deal with torrents of data in near-real time. Reacting quickly enough to deal with data velocity is a challenge for most organizations.

- **Variety**. Data today comes in all types of formats. Structured, numeric data in traditional databases. Information created from line-of-business applications. Unstructured text documents, email, video, audio, stock ticker data and financial transactions. Managing, merging and governing different varieties of data is something many organizations still grapple with.
