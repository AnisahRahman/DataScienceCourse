\section{What is Big Data?}
Big data (also spelled Big Data) is a general term used to describe the voluminous amount of unstructured and semi-structured data a company creates, data that would take too much time and cost too much money to load into a relational database for analysis. Although Big data doesn't refer to any specific quantity, the term is often used when speaking about \textbf{\emph{petabytes}} and \textbf{\emph{exabytes}} of data.


A primary goal for looking at big data is to discover repeatable business patterns. Its generally accepted that unstructured data, most of it located in text files, accounts for at least $80\%$ of an organizations data. If left unmanaged, the sheer volume of unstructured data thats generated each year within an enterprise can be costly in terms of storage. Unmanaged data can also pose a liability if information cannot be located in the event of a compliance audit or lawsuit.

Big data analytics is often associated with cloud computing because the analysis of large data sets in real-time requires a framework like \textbf{\emph{MapReduce}} to distribute the work among tens, hundreds or even thousands of computers.
