This course will go over basic installation, JSON, schema design, querying, insertion of data, indexing and working with language drivers. We will also cover working in sharded and replicated environments. In the course, you will build a blogging platform, backed by MongoDB. Our code examples will be given in Python. A brief Python introduction is included in the course. 


Several worldwide reports have highlighted a shortage of talent in this area. 
The McKinsey Global Institute (2011) has reported that there will be a shortage 
of talent necessary for organisations to take advantage of business intelligence 
and data analytics. MGI predicts that “by 2018, the United States 
alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep 
analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with
 the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions”. 
A 2011 Bloomberg Businessweek Research Services survey of global businesses 
(published in 2012) shows that 97% of companies with revenues of more than 
$100 million are using some form of business analytics. 
43\% of these companies reported plans to increase analytical talent. Locally some estimates indicate a skills shortage of over 3,000 graduates with analytics skills in Ireland during the same period. This programme has been developed in consultation with large organisations in IT, finance and consulting in order to suit their business needs and thus securing future employment for graduates.

\section{Mortar Data}

Mortar Data is Hadoop for developers, plain and simple. The company has offered its cloud service — which replaces MapReduce with a combination Pig and Python — for almost a year. In November, it released the open source Mortar framework in order to build a community around sharing datasets and making it easier to write Hadoop pipelines. Mortar Data runs atop Amazon Web Services and currently supports Amazon S3 and MongoDB (hosted on Amazon EC2) as data sources.
